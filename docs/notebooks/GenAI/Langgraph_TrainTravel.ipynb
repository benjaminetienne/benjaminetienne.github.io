    "Many AI applications interact directly with humans. In these cases, it is appropriate for models to respond in natural language. But what about cases where we want a model to also interact directly with systems, such as databases or an API? These systems often have a particular input schema; for example, APIs frequently have a required payload structure. This need motivates the concept of tool calling. You can use tool calling to request model responses that match a particular schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps for using tools :\n",
    "1. Tool Creation: Use the @tool decorator to create a tool. A tool is an association between a function and its schema.\n",
    "2. Tool Binding: The tool needs to be connected to a model that supports tool calling. This gives the model awareness of the tool and the associated input schema required by the tool.\n",
    "3. Tool Calling: When appropriate, the model can decide to call a tool and ensure its response conforms to the tool's input schema.\n",
    "4. Tool Execution: The tool can be executed using the arguments provided by the model."

    "### Langgraph philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, LangGraph models agent workflows as graphs. You define the behavior of your agents using three key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `State`: A shared data structure that represents the current snapshot of your application. It can be any Python type, but is typically a TypedDict or Pydantic BaseModel.\n",
    "- `Nodes`: Python functions that encode the logic of your agents. They receive the current State as input, perform some computation or side-effect, and return an updated State.\n",
    "- `Edges`: Python functions that determine which Node to execute next based on the current State. They can be conditional branches or fixed transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By composing Nodes and Edges, you can create complex, looping workflows that evolve the State over time. The real power, though, comes from how LangGraph manages that State. To emphasize: Nodes and Edges are nothing more than Python functions - they can contain an LLM or just good ol' Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: nodes do the work. edges tell what to do next."
